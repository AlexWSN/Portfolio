        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-text">
          <p>
            I had the pleasure of working for over 5 years as a supervisor in
            parental education. During this time, I was involved in meaningful
            and impactful projects, and I like to believe that, together with my
            team, we made a positive difference on a national level,
            collaborating with schools and educational institutions all across
            Romania. Still, I felt I hadnâ€™t quite found my place. After
            completing an intensive one-year fullstack development course, I
            decided to transition into a field that felt closer to my heart â€”
            partly out of a desire to connect with people who share my mindset
            and passions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love painting â€” it helps me stay grounded and expressive in ways
            words can't always reach. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve included a small selection
            of my artwork in this portfolio: itâ€™s a glimpse into the way I see
            and feel the world. Music is my constant companion â€” mostly heavy
            metal (with a funky start to every morning), and visual creativity
            flows alongside it. I've always been fascinated by 3D modeling,
            especially character design. Over the past year, Iâ€™ve been learning
            Blender in my spare time, and Iâ€™ve added here a few of my early
            experiments with digital sculpting â€” raw, but made with joy. Iâ€™m the
            proud owner of a hope: that one day Iâ€™ll learn to play the cello
            beautifully and own a '90 Honda Prelude.
