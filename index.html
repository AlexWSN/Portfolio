        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-text">
          <p>
            I’m a Junior Full-Stack Developer with 5 years of experience as a
            supervisor in parental education. After completing an intensive
            full-stack course, I transitioned into IT to combine creativity and
            logic in building intuitive, user-centered applications. I’m
            passionate about clean code, responsive design, and meaningful user
            experiences. My technical skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
            React, and Node.js, along with strong soft skills developed through
            years of coordinating and guiding teams in the field of parental
            education.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m eager to grow and absorb as much knowledge as possible. Although
            my current job leaves me little time for personal projects, I’m
            highly motivated to contribute, learn, and evolve in a real
            development team.
